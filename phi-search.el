;; Author: zk_phi
;; URL: http://hins11.yu-yake.com/
;; Version: 1.1.3

;;; Commentary:

;; Add following expression in your init file :
;;
;;   (require 'phi-search)
;;
;; and bind command "phi-search"
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-s") 'phi-search)

;; In *phi-search* buffer, following commands are available.
;;
;; - [C-s] phi-search-again-or-next
;;
;;   Move to the next matching item. If query is blank, use the last
;;   query.
;;
;; - [C-r] phi-search-again-or-previous
;;
;;   Similar to phi-search-again-or-next, but move to the previous item.
;;
;; - [RET] phi-search-complete
;;
;;   Finish searching.
;;
;; - [C-g] phi-search-abort
;;
;;   Finish searching, and move back to the original position.

;; For more details, see "Readme".

;;; Change Log:

;; 1.0.0 first released
;; 1.0.1 working better with regions
;;       added phi-search-complete-and-xxxx commands
;; 1.0.2 fixed phi-search-complete-and-xxxx commands
;;       better compatibility for multiple-cursors
;; 1.0.3 fixed bug that nurumacs does not work while inserting query
;;       changed mode-line-format
;;       renamed some private functions
;; 1.1.0 cleaned-up
;;       removed "phi-search-keybindings" and added "phi-search-mode-map"
;;       now calls "isearch" if the window is popwin window
;; 1.1.1 use "sublimity" not "nurumacs"
;; 1.1.2 added phi-search-backward command
;; 1.1.3 better integration with sublimity

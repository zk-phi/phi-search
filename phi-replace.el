;; Author: zk_phi
;; URL: http://hins11.yu-yake.com/
;; Version: 1.0.1

;;; Commentary:

;; Add following expression in your init file :
;;
;;   (require 'phi-replace)
;;
;; and bind command "phi-replace" or "phi-replace-query"
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "M-%") 'phi-replace)

;; In *phi-replace* buffer, following commands are available.
;;
;; - [C-v] phi-replace-scroll-down
;;
;;   Scroll the target window down, to check candidates.
;;
;; - [M-v] phi-replace-scroll-up
;;
;;   Scroll the target window up.
;;
;; - [RET] phi-replace-complete
;;
;;   Execute replace. If query is blank, use the last query.
;;
;; - [C-g] phi-search-abort
;;
;;   Quit phi-replace without executing.

;; For more details, see "Readme".

;;; Change Log:

;; 1.0.0 first released
;; 1.0.1 added weight for phi-replace
;; 1.0.2 use "sublimity" not "nurumacs"
